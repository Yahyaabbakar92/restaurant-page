## Some thoughts

- I struggled to get the pages to tab "correctly", and I ended up using innerHTML to help me work it out.
- I wrote repeated code lines everywhere, certainly to get the project finished but I will come back to refactor it.
- I could use factory functions to create repeated headings, paragraphs, and for classes to name a few.
